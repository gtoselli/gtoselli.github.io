I was born in 2000 in _Monza_, Italy. When I was 14, my parents didn't want to buy me a computer, so I bought a raspberry pi. I fell in love with it and founded [raspberryitaly.com](https://www.raspberryitaly.com/ "raspberryitaly.com") in 2015.
During my high school years I developed telegram bots in python and a few websites for small local businesses.

In 2018 I met [Golee](https://golee.it/ "Golee") through a friend. Talking (randomly) about "microservices", "varnish cache" and "nginix for load balancing" impressed the interviewer who hired me.

During my early years at Golee I developed a backend (some horrible "microservices") in python (with Flask) for a mobile application aimed at sports coaches.
After a few months I fell in love with NodeJs.

Currently, in Golee I am the main backend developer. We have an event-driven infrastructure of about 25 services.
In recent years we have been very attracted to DDD and its various implementations.
We currently have about 10 modules implemented in event sourcing and another 10 with CQRS without ES.

The mistakes made and lessons learned gave me the idea for this little blog.

When I am not working, I am a scout leader (in the department since 2020) or travel (overland style).
